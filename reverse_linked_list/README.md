# IN PROGRESS

# Requirements
- A C compiler that supports **C11** (e.g., GCC 4.9+, Clang 3.3+, or MSVC 2015+).

# USAGE
This program does not expect command line arguments, it asks the user for text inputs. It takes input, outputs the created list & the reversed list. 

```bash
cd reverse_linked_list/src
gcc reverse_linked_list.c -o prog 
./prog 
```
